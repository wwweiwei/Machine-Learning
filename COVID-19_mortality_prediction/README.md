# COVID-19 mortality prediction
- Goal: To build a machine learning model to predict the 30-day mortality of patients
- Dataset: 
  - There are 1,834 patients in the training dataset and each with a unique ID and 47 attributes.
  - The dimensionality of the data is 1,834 *48
  - 1,834 hospital outcome for all patients will be provided and used as the labels.
- Evaluation: Recall and Precision
