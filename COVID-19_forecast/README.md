# COVID-19 forecast
- Goal: 
  - To build a machine learning model to predict the future of COIVD-19 new cases of each country
  - To predict the cases from 10/9 to 10/15 for each country
- Dataset: https://reurl.cc/q8LWap
- Evaluation matrix: MAPE (Mean absolute percentage error)
  - For example: 
    - The value you predicted: 𝑦 ̂_𝑖 = [39356, 40034, 38176, 34418, 32710, 32234, 36450]                 
    - Ground Truth : 𝑦_𝑖  = [50209, 43567, 24598, 51473, 34841, 33871, 40820]
    - MAPE = 1/7 *1.397 = 0.1995 = 19.95%
